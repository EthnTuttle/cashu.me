      <h3>üéÆ Your Unit's Combat Stats</h3>
      <p>Every unit in Manastr derives its <strong>magical properties</strong> from its unique <strong>C value signature</strong> - a cryptographic fingerprint that ensures your unit's stats are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unpredictable:</strong> No one can predict what stats a unit will have before minting</li>
        <li><strong>Tamper-Proof:</strong> Stats cannot be modified or hacked</li>
        <li><strong>Verifiable:</strong> Anyone can verify your unit's stats are legitimate</li>
        <li><strong>Unique:</strong> Each unit has a distinct magical signature</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This system prevents cheating while creating exciting variety in your army. When you receive a new mana token, you're opening a magical "loot box" with guaranteed authenticity!</p>

      <h3>üîß Cashu C Value Deterministic Generation</h3>
      <p>The <strong>C value</strong> is the unblinded signature from the Cashu mint's blind signing process. This 256-bit cryptographic commitment serves as a deterministic seed for generating unit properties.</p>
      
      <h4>Process:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Mint Operation:</strong> When you request mana tokens, the mint creates a blind signature</li>
        <li><strong>Unblinding:</strong> Your wallet unblinds the signature, revealing the C value</li>
        <li><strong>Property Extraction:</strong> Different segments of the C value determine different properties</li>
        <li><strong>Deterministic Hashing:</strong> Hash functions ensure consistent property generation</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>Security Benefits:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Properties are derived from cryptographic randomness</li>
        <li>No trusted party controls unit generation</li>
        <li>All property calculations are verifiable</li>
        <li>Impossible to predict properties before minting</li>
